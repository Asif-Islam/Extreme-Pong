Final Product of Extreme Pong

This is a final uploaded project of Extreme Pong. Previous versions of the program are unfortunately not available.

Extreme Pong is a fun project of mine to try to excite the classic Pong game with some more modern features. Some of these feature include:

  : Unique Paddles: Each paddle has different benefits (speed, size, hitting strength) 
 
  : Paddle abilities: All paddle have a special ability: The Magic Paddle will make the ball change y-positions every couple hundred         miliseconds for example: The Speed paddle creates 5 duplicates of the ball, with only one being real! 
  
  : Powerups: Powerups are present throughout the game to weaken your opponent. This includes control-switching, screen flipping and a       special powerup that makes the ball follow parabloic motion!
  
  : Competent AI: The AI built will act exactly as a human. It will track the ball's motion, use it's paddle's qualities to it's             advantage and appropriate times it's powerup usage as would a regular player. The AI will also react to powerups like "control           -switching" and mimic a human's reaction to the powerup, leading to a realistic playing environment
  
  
  Feel free to look through the code and give it a try!
